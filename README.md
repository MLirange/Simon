# Simon
Refactored Simon Codealong with added functionality from Angela Yu's Bootcamp

This project was initially meant to be a jQuery exercise, but I thought it would 
be an interesting project to complete with vanilla JS. HTML and CSS layout was provided
by the bootcamp, but the JS code and logic was designed from scratch. Current and high score 
tracking was also added to the original project as this was not in the original instructions.
