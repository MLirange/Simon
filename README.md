# Simon
Refactored Simon Codealong with added functionality from Angela Yu's Bootcamp

This project was initially meant to be a jQuery exercise, but I thought it would 
be an interesting project to complete with vanilla JS. HTML and CSS was provided
by the bootcamp, but the JS code and logic was designed from scratch by me.
